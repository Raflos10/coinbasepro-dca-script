# Dollar Cost Averaging script for Coinbase Pro
This is just a python script that buys bitcoin on Coinbase Pro. 
It checks your USD balance, if it's low it initiates a transfer from your specified bank, then buys the specified amount in bitcoin.
Set this script on a cron job to run weekly, daily, even hourly, and you can dollar cost average into Bitcoin. 

Coinbase does have a recurring order feature on their website, but the fees are extremely high. Using this script I estimate I'm saving hundreds of dollars in fees annually!
